# Equip-chain
This is proof of concept on Blockchain for the Lab Equipment exchange process using Multichain

This project presents the implementation of Blockchain technology for tracking the movement of assets/equipment within the organization effectively and to share the asset/equipment without any formal authorizations. There are several methods to track the movement of goods using different custom developed software applications. In this work, software application is developed taking Blockchain as its back bone. HTML, CSS, Java script are used to develop the User interface of this application. Python is used to build the server program. SMS service Twilio has been used in this application to send the OTP. Usage of Blockchain Technology for this application makes it superior than the other applications in terms of data security and immutability of data. Asset transfer can be made transparent or private to all the users in the chain subject to the application. Once after the submission of the data it can never be overridden or countermanded.
